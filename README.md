# Dotnet C# Examples
This repository contains C# code examples using the MoneyMoov API. The examples are written to operate in the NoFrixion sandbox environment.

Each subfolder contains examples of the api endpoints associated with a group of functions:

- accounts: list accounts and account transactions
- metadata: useful for API troubleshooting and diagnostics
- payouts (coming soon): endpoints for creating and approving payouts (the sending of funds)
- transfers (coming soon): send funds between accounts belonging to the same merchant
- user (coming soon): reading and updating user profiles, associated merchants and creating and refreshing access tokens

We will continue adding examples as the API develops. For more details see our API documentation

## Dotnet Version
The examples in this repository were developed and tested using .NET 6.
