# Dotnet C# Examples
This repository contains C# code examples using the MoneyMoov API. The examples are written to operate in the NoFrixion sandbox environment.

Each subfolder contains examples of the api endpoints associated with a group of functions:

- accounts: list accounts and account transactions
- metadata: useful for API troubleshooting and diagnostics
- payouts: endpoints for creating and approving payouts (the sending of funds)
- transfers: send funds between accounts belonging to the same merchant
- users: reading and updating user profiles, associated merchants and creating and refreshing (coming soon) access tokens

We will continue adding examples as the API develops. For more details see our API documentation

## Dotnet Version
The examples in this repository were developed and tested using .NET 6.
